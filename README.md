# Project Title
ReferEarn Protocol

---

## Project Description
This project incentivizes players to refer new users to a platform by rewarding both the referrer and the referee with bonus tokens. The system uses blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. The project involves two smart contracts: one for managing the ERC-20 token (*FlipToken*) and another for handling referral logic.

## Project Vision
The aim of the project is to promote user acquisition and engagement by leveraging a gamified referral system. By introducing a transparent and trustless blockchain-based mechanism, users can trust that their rewards are handled fairly, and the platform benefits from a growing and active user base.

## Key Features
1. **ERC-20 Token Implementation:**
   - A custom token, *FlipToken* (symbol: FLIP), is created with a fixed supply.
   - Tokens can be minted by the contract owner for rewarding referrals.

2. **Referral System:**
   - Users can register referrals using a secure, decentralized smart contract.
   - Bonus tokens are distributed to both referrers and referees upon fulfilling conditions.

3. **Reward Structure:**
   - Referrers earn 10 FLIP tokens per successful referral.
   - Referees earn 5 FLIP tokens as a welcome bonus.

4. **Security Features:**
   - Referees cannot refer themselves.
   - Each user can claim a referral bonus only once.

5. **Transparency:**
   - The system is fully deployed on the Ethereum Layer 3 Edu Chain for low-cost, scalable transactions.
